# Pull-off force prediction in viscoelastic adhesive Hertzian contact by physics augmented machine learning

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning models that integrate physics-based principles to enhance the prediction accuracy of pull-off force in viscoelastic adhesive Hertzian contact. By leveraging both **data-driven** and **physics-augmented ML** techniques, the approach provides improved generalization. The results are provided in a manuscript written by **Ali Maghami**, **Merten Stender**, and **Antonio Papangelo**.

The Python codes are written by Ali Maghami, a PhD researcher at **Politecnico di Bari, Italy**, and a research scholar at **Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, Germany**. The project is a sub-project of the **ERC-Funded project of ERC-2021-STG**, "Towards Future Interfaces With Tuneable Adhesion By Dynamic Excitation" - SURFACE (Project ID: 101039198, CUP: D95F22000430006) at TriboDynamics Lab (https://tribodynamicslab.poliba.it/).

## Features
- **Physics-Augmented Machine Learning**: Incorporates physical laws (Persson & Brenner model) into ML models.
- **Dataset Included**: Provides data for training and validation.
- **Multiple Models**: Compares different ML techniques.
- **Reproducible Code**: Easy-to-follow scripts and notebooks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alimaghamii/ML4Adhesion
   cd ML4Adhesion
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the dataset**  
   - Ensure the dataset is available in the `Data_Files` directory.

2. **Run machine learning models**  
   - To evaluate a data-driven model for pull-off force:
     ```bash
     python ML_Adh_predict.py
     ```
   - To evaluate a physics-augmented model for pull-off force:
     ```bash
     python PML_Adh_predict.py
     ```
   - To evaluate a data-driven model for work to pull off:
     ```bash
     python ML_Adh_predict_W.py
     ```
   - To evaluate a physics-augmented model for work to pull off:
     ```bash
     python PML_Adh_predict_W.py
     ```
